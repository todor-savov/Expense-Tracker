   - Enable **Authentication**, **Firebase Realtime Database**, and **Storage** from the Firebase dashboard.
   - Generate Firebase credentials from **Project Settings > General > Your Apps > Config**.
5. **Set up Firebase environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables (the example below uses Vite for project setup):
